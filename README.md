## 📋 Project Overview

This is a browser-based Blackjack game that allows players to draw cards and try to reach 21 without going over. The project demonstrates fundamental web development concepts including DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation.

## 🎮 Features

- **Start Game**: Begin a new round with two random cards
- **Draw Cards**: Add new cards to your hand during gameplay
- **Score Tracking**: Automatic calculation of card totals
- **Game Status**: Real-time feedback on game state (win, lose, or continue)
- **Player Profile**: Display player name and chip count
- **Card Logic**: Proper Blackjack rules (Face cards = 10, Aces = 11)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout
- **CSS3**: Styling with custom background and button designs
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Game logic and interactivity

## 📁 File Structure

```

├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── index.css           # Styling and visual design
├── index.js            # Game logic and functionality
└── images/

```

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Click **START GAME** to receive your initial two cards
2. Check your sum:
   - If you have 21, you win with Blackjack!
   - If you have less than 21, you can draw another card
   - If you go over 21, you're out of the game
3. Click **NEW CARD** to draw additional cards (only available during active gameplay)
4. Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure you have the background image at `images/table.png`
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser
4. Start playing!

## 💡 Key Learning Concepts

Through this project, I practiced:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting and updating HTML elements dynamically
- **Event Handling**: Responding to button clicks
- **Arrays**: Storing and managing card data
- **Conditional Logic**: Implementing game rules and win/lose conditions
- **Functions**: Organizing code into reusable blocks
- **Objects**: Managing player data with properties
- **Random Number Generation**: Creating unpredictable card draws

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements I'm considering:

- Add betting functionality with chip management
- Implement a dealer's hand for full Blackjack rules
- Add animations for card dealing
- Include sound effects
- Create a win/loss statistics tracker
- Add ability to customize player name
- Implement proper Ace handling (1 or 11 based on situation)

## 📝 Notes

This project is part of my web development learning journey. The code focuses on clarity and fundamental concepts rather than advanced optimization.
